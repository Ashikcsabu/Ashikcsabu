Hi, I'm Ashik, a SIMATS Engineering student passionate about AI and ML. I'm a skilled Python, C, C++, and Java programmer with experience in prompt engineering. 
I use my skills to develop AI and ML models that solve real-world problems. I'm also ready for freelancing and eager to use my skills to help others.
