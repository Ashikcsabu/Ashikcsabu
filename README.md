❖  **Emotion Decoder (Aug 2024)** 
   <p>The "Speech Emotion Decoder." It’s an advanced tool that decodes emotions purely from audio. The backbone of this project is a custom-built deep learning model, which I trained using popular audio datasets like RAVDESS, TESS, and SAVEE. These datasets feature the voices of native English speakers, representing a wide range of emotions. I created a convolutional neural network that predicts emotional labels from audio input by breaking down the audio file into smaller chunks. We then generate a spectrogram using Fourier transform and extract something called MFCCs—Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients. These are a set of features that describe the shape of the audio signal’s spectral envelope and then predict the emotion label for each 3 sec audio chunks.</p>

❖  **Neumeral Technologies (Present)**

Role : ML Engineer

During this internship at NEUMERAL TECHNOLOGIES, I have been working on a project of an open online course platform. With primary focus on integrating machine learning techniques into the platform. This work involves data collecton, data cleaning, creating custom models for specific tasks, fine-tuning available LLMs, and integrating these models using APIs. This internship has provided me with an opportunity to enhance my skills in Machine Learning, Data Analytics, NLP, Deep Learning, Fine-Tuning LLMs, LangChain, Ollama, Django, REST API framework, and Version Control, as well as gain insights into the workflow of development tasks.

❖  **Omdena Milan Chapter (May 2024 - July 2024)**

Role : Jr.ML Engineer

During my tenure as a Junior Machine Learning Engineer at the Omdena Milan Chapter, I contributed significantly by creating a Milan crops dataset and a detailed salads datasheet, and by developing and evaluating machine learning models like RandomForest and XGBoost for yield prediction. I achieved accurate results with XGBoost, updated our GitHub repository with the code, and actively participated in team meetings, fostering effective collaboration and communication. This experience enhanced my skills in data analysis, model development, and teamwork.
